# Child Containers

:warning: **Parent/child containers were never properly designed.** The thing just fell into place as is.
They are not recommended unless you have deep understanding of the inner workings of Windsor.
However, you are welcome to contribute changes to them.

Your use case may be better suited to using an [`IHandlerSelector`](handler-selectors.md) to override specific
registrations or a [scoped lifestyle](lifestyles.md#scoped).
