# Windsor Tutorial - ASP.NET MVC 3 application (To be Seen)

This is introductory tutorial that will get you up to speed with using Windsor in a simple web application. The
application is called *To be seen* and helps user collect information about upcoming movies, CDs, books, events etc, and
set up reminders for when they come up.

The tutorial assumes no prior familiarity with Windsor, any other container or related concepts. However a sound
knowledge of C# and some experience with ASP.NET (hopefully in its MVC incarnation) is required.

You can find the entire code for finished application [on github](https://github.com/kkozmic/ToBeSeen).
